# Printing
1) Compile all the images you'd like to print into a folder
2) Run:  
`magick montage * -geometry +100+100 -tile 3x4 -background transparent ../output/mf100.png`  
(you should tinker with `+100+100` like using `+200+200` to get your desired result)  
`-tile 3x4` places the images on a 3x4 grid. If you place too many images in, you will make a huge image that Redbubble won't accept.
3) Upload the image to Redbubble and check that the stickers are separated (no intersecting white areas), so that they come correctly cut from the factory.
4) Order them from Redbubble. I'd recommend looking at Large and Extra Large if you printed 3x4, otherwise the smallest size works well for just one image.
